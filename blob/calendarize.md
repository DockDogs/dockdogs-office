### Events Import

* Events are imported via a script twice a day. I believe the script runs at 5pm and 2am EST, however, I may be mistaken.
* Events can also be imported via accessing [http://dockdogs.com/cron](http://dockdogs.com/cron). 
* * This page is white and doesn't have any content on it, however, if there are new events to be imported, it will get them and display them for you in the WordPress admin area. 
* Events only import once. Subsequently, if any changes are made in the Neova application to Wave schedules, dates, or any other information the event doesn't update in WordPress.
* * This will be changing at a later date.

### Managing an event that has just been imported

* Login to WordPress
* Click "Calendarize" in the left hand menu
* Click "Events" in the left hand menu
* Locate the event you're looking for by using the pagination or search based on the name of the event.
* Click "Edit Event" 

#### Edits that need to be completed for EACH & EVERY EVENT
* Template Defaults Reset (**Click "Reset to default template"**)

#### Updating Content/Schedule Details
* Any edits to Wave times or anything can be done in the "Visual" tab of the editor just like any standard WYSIWYG interface. Should be fairly self-explanatory, if you have any questions please advise.
* * Practice times & Finals are coming very soon in Neova and will be displayed inside of the event schedules and subsequently pushed to the website. However, all existing events already imported into dockdogs.com will not be updated. _**For any existing events that you wish to add practice times, onsite registration time, or finals to you'll simply add those details manually using the WYSIWYG editor and then click "UPDATE" on the right-hand sidebar to save the record.**_

#### Adding Sponsor Logos
* I'll provide you an update on this at a later date. However, this is very important and we need to make sure we keep up with it this year.
